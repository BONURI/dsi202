# Rent Near TU

## Abstract

Housing is a fundamental factor that significantly affects quality of life, especially for populations with income constraints, such as students, laborers, or middle- to low-income families. These groups often face difficulties accessing affordable rental housing that meets their needs, particularly in areas near Thammasat University, where there is high demand for accommodation. However, current systems for finding rental housing still lack centralized information and flexibility in selecting accommodations based on budget and real-life living factors.

In response to this problem, the developers have created a web application called “Rent Near Tu” as a solution to assist income constrained individuals in conveniently and efficiently finding rental rooms or dormitories near Thammasat University. This application is developed using Django, a framework well suited for systems that require organized data management. It is designed to serve both “tenants” and “landlords.” Tenants can search for accommodations based on their budget, desired basic amenities, and make reservations, while landlords can directly list their properties, ensuring that the system contains up-to-date and diverse information. The system is designed to be user friendly to maximize the efficiency of accommodation searches.

This project not only focuses on using technology to facilitate the search for housing but also has a social goal reducing inequality in access to housing for those with low incomes or limited resources. It aims to alleviate financial burdens, increase residential stability, and create opportunities for education and employment in the long term. Furthermore, the system has the potential to be scaled and applied in other areas with similar population characteristics and issues in the future.
