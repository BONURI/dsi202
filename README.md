# Rent Near TU: Affordable Dormitory Solution for Thammasat University

## Abstract

### Purpose
Housing is a fundamental factor that significantly affects quality of life, especially for people with income constraints such as students, laborers, and low- to middle-income families. These groups often face challenges in accessing affordable and suitable rental accommodations—particularly in areas near Thammasat University’s Rangsit campus, where housing demand is high. Existing housing search systems typically lack centralized information and the flexibility to filter options based on budget and real-life living needs.

To address this issue, the Rent Near TU web application was developed as an accessible and efficient platform designed to help income constrained individuals find affordable dormitories and rental rooms near Thammasat University. Built on the robust and reliable Django Web Framework, the platform serves both tenants particularly students and laborers and property owners. Tenants can search for housing based on their budget and essential amenities and make reservations directly, while landlords can manage and update their listings in real time, ensuring fresh and diverse housing information.

Rent Near TU is not only a technological solution to facilitate housing searches, but it also carries a strong social mission to reduce inequality in housing access for people with limited income and resources. By lowering the cost and time associated with searching for accommodations, the platform promotes housing security and expands opportunities for education and employment. Additionally, the system is designed for scalability, allowing future expansion to other communities that face similar demographic and housing challenges.
